# DiSH
The Discord SHell Client

This project is currently a Work in Progress, but is useable.

## What Works?
- Sending and Receiving messages from Discord Servers
- Browsing Text Channels

## What's Coming?
- Direct Message Support
- Notifications for DM's/Server Messages
- Image URL Parsing
- Server Nickname support
- @mentions will translate to the user's nickname

## Installing
Just run the built binary, or the python3 script.
After your first run, it'll prompt you to edit ~/.DiSH/Settings.json. Make sure you get your discord private token and add it to there.
